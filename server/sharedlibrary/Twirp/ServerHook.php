/**
 * ServerHooks is a container for callbacks that can instrument a
 * Twirp-generated server. These callbacks all accept a context and return a
 * context. They can use this to add to the request context as it threads
 * through the system, appending values or deadlines to it.
 *
 * The requestReceived and requestRouted hooks are special: they can return
 * errors (in form of exceptions).
 * If they trigger an error, handling for that request will be
 * stopped at that point. The Error hook will be triggered, and the error will
 * be sent to the client. This can be used for stuff like auth checks before
 * deserializing a request.
 *
 * The requestReceived hook is always called first, and it is called for every
 * request that the Twirp server handles. The last hook to be called in a
 * request's lifecycle is always responseSent, even in the case of an error.
 *
 * Details on the timing of each hook are documented as comments on the methods
 * of the ServerHooks type.
